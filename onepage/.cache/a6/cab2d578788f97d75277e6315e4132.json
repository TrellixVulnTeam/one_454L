<h3>I am a creative.</h3> <h3>I am constantly learning.</h3> <h3>I rise to new challenges.</h3> </div> <p>I started University studying Fine Art at UWE Bristol but soon realised it was digital art I wanted to study. This prompted me to change courses, jumping into the second year of Digital Art & Technology (now referred to as Digital Media Design) at Plymouth University.<br> The curriculum consisted of a mixture of projects, all creative, but some with a larger amount of programming involved. Consequently, I became submerged in many aspects of web development, using my varied design skills to inform technical decisions and conversely, informing design with technical understanding and best practice. Both mutually compatible and providing a robust platform from which to create dynamic and well structured web applications.<br> I graduated in 2019 with a First Class Honours, and after a year in my first industry role as a Front-End Developer at BillBuddy, I am now looking for new opportunities. </p> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class=\"projects\" id=\"projects-section\"> <div class=\"core__content\"> <h3 class=\"centered\">PROJECTS</h3> <div class=\"projects__inner\"> <div class=\"grid-x\"> <div class=\"cell large-4 medium-12\"> <div class=\"projects__inner__box\"> <img src=\"/59e026d35da52a20b0c61e8c70ad3379.webp\"> <div class=\"projects__inner__box__text\"> <h5>ABSTRACTION</h5> <p>The conception of a human augmentation library.</p> <i class=\"fa-chevron-left fas\"></i><a id=\"human\">READ MORE</a><i class=\"fa-chevron-right fas\"></i> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"cell large-4 medium-12\"> <div class=\"projects__inner__box\"> <img src=\"/b93a1607071c8d698e443efc5afb5059.webp\"> <div class=\"projects__inner__box__text\"> <h5>BILLBUDDY</h5> <p>My graduate role as a Front-End Developer at BillBuddy.</p> <i class=\"fa-chevron-left fas\"></i><a id=\"billbuddy\">READ MORE</a><i class=\"fa-chevron-right fas\"></i> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"cell large-4 medium-12\"> <div class=\"projects__inner__box\"> <img src=\"/88ab5faacfda8b0d88fa802e46d42899.webp\"> <div class=\"projects__inner__box__text\"> <h5>INCOGNITO</h5> <p>Project surrounding digital privacy and information.</p> <i class=\"fa-chevron-left fas\"></i><a id=\"project\">READ MORE</a><i class=\"fa-chevron-right fas\"></i> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <div class=\"projects__modal__background\"></div> <div class=\"projects__modal\" id=\"human-modal\"> <div class=\"projects__modal__title\"> <i class=\"fa-times fas\"></i> <h3>ABSTRACTION</h3> </div> <p>This was my final year project during my BA in Digital Art and Design, in which I received a First Class Honours for both project and overall.<br> The concept was an interactive library for futuristic augmentations, in which the user picked up the individual item from the podium and scanned it, resulting in the accompanying informative animation being played on the screen in front of the user.<br> I began with 2D designs of each augmentation, developing these into 3D designs, and finally created an animation for each.

At this time the company was seeking someone who could learn quickly and work well with other developers, collaborating on larger tasks and taking on smaller ones themselves.<br> Three months into the role, after getting up to speed with the codebase structure and common patterns, I was tasked with re-designing the site and re-building the front of house. This was a huge responsibility, which I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish. I created new design assets such as phone mockups and animations and mixed these with CSS animation and structural changes for a brighter and more contemporary feel.<br> The remaining months have consisted of building new features, learning to use API's in a variety of ways (from Google Maps to fetching data on offers and building elements with Typescript components) and getting more involved in the back end with the use of Python and other languages such as YAML. I have also been introduced to the Agile workflow, well versed in the power of Scrum!<br> I pride myself on being multi-disciplinary, able to move around the Adobe Creative Suite and mix these skills into development. I'm looking to move into a role where design/UX is a key component of the development cycle, influencing technical decisions on a daily basis. </p> <div class=\"projects__modal__tiles\"> <div class=\"grid-x\"> <div class=\"cell medium-6 small-12\"> <img src=\"/e83db7dcee722f19fdafd5326764e037.webp\"> <img src=\"/cb824cb5f859f3f12d09a5561914c4b1.webp\"> <img src=\"/44e4822ce21bc5015fd73e669becfd76.webp\"> <img src=\"/8ea833ee81dd163121d6351d5ef149f1.webp\"> </div> <div class=\"cell medium-6 small-12\"> <img src=\"/0b06a3f513fe96057ba0b2adbad98049.webp\"> <img src=\"/5d34afa774898946eed0ac951c62c5d0.webp\"> <img src=\"/935ce878bded4f4739b462b6f259cda5.webp\"> <img src=\"/044679f8921cca5560266dfb8f6fc0c6.webp\"> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"projects__modal\" id=\"project-modal\"> <div class=\"projects__modal__title\"> <i class=\"fa-times fas\"></i> <h3>INCOGNITO</h3> </div> <p>During the final year of my degree, I was part of a group project exploring the theme of data protection (looks like we were ahead of the GDPR rollout!).<br> The concept was to take a seemingly analog item and hide a digital element within it. We chose to take an old typewriter and install a flexible bar sensor on the underside of the piece of metal that each key arm moved toward on each stroke. The sensor had a range from 0 to 1550 once in place, this was mapped from 0 to 88 to make assigning values to each key cleaner. With installation complete and functions written to handle converting the sensor values to keys, we connected a small shredder and used it as our 'trigger'. The act of putting paper through the teeth caused the most recent message typed to be sent to our database and then printed out at another location (in this case in another room). We invited users to enter a room and answer personal questions presented to them on a screen infront of the podium on which the typewriter was placed - allowing us to hide wires and the RaspberryPi it was connected to inside the podium itself. The physical act of 'destroying' their answers became the antithetical action, essentially handing them to us. </p> <div class=\"projects__modal__tiles\"> <div class=\"grid-x\"> <div class=\"cell medium-6 small-12\"> <img src=\"/800aba8dfa11f3bc49eaca57faf27595.webp\"> <img src=\"/f3220d02db77837a7c73c721fc4d160a.webp\"> </div> <div class=\"cell medium-6 small-12\"> <img src=\"/d5df17931a6695f237cee054189835c5.webp\"> <img src=\"/6591868273b4783b598aa4467d9cce18.webp\"> </div> </div> </div> </div> <section id=\"binary-section\" class=\"binary\"> <canvas id=\"canvas\"></canvas> <div class=\"binary__content\"> <h3>GET IN TOUCH</h3> <p>I believe I would be an asset to any team.
